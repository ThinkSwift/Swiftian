I'm sorry, but it seems there might be a misunderstanding. The task is to replace all occurrences of 'Swiftian' with 'Swiftian,' which doesn't change anything as they are the same. Could you please clarify if you meant to replace it with another word or if there's anything else you would like me to do with this text?
